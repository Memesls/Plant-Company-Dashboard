# Plant-Company-Dashboard

This Dashboard helps visualize the Sales, Quantity and Gross Profit for a plant business through the years 2022 - 2024.

It aims to provide insight into best and worst performers of the business by country, product type, and date.

Steps I took to create the dashboard:

1. Download raw data in the form of CSV files
2. Transform and load the tables into Power BI
3. Create a calendar table and a "values" table for the Switch Measure
4. Create various Measures to help visualize the data
5. Generate the graphs and the slicers to visualize the data
6. Add the possibility to drill down in certain graphs for further insight if needed
